# Reinforced learning PoC: Learning to drive a car in Unity

@authors: Manuel Guevara & Rafael Lazcano 2020.

## Introduction

This project is intended to solve a series of questions:
1. How much effort does it take to build an Unity system as a reinforcement learning env?
2. Can we design a basic agent that learns to sucessfully drive a 3D car?

Depending on the answers, we will further explore the possibilities and applications of training agents in Unity. Some 
of said applications could be accelerating robotics training, intelligent agents for videogames and discovering strategies
in simulated environments that later can be applied to the real world.

### Technology 
* Unity version: 2018.2.17
* Python
